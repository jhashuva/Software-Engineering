Process: A Generic View

A software process 
is a roadmap to building high quality software products. 
provides a framework for managing activities. 
adapts to meet needs of software engineers and managers.
 
Different types of projects require different software processes.
 
Best indicators of how well a process worked are the quality, timeliness, and long-term viability of the resulting software product.


Software Processes :

What is a process?
Sequence of steps required to develop or maintain software


Characteristics
prescribes major activities
constraints and controls apply to activities, resources, and products
utilizes resources, subject to constraints such as schedule, to produce intermediate and final results
constraints on activities: time, budget, tools
controls on activities: config. mgmt, reports


A Process Framework:

Process framework
Framework activities
  work tasks
  work products
  milestones & deliverables
  QA checkpoints
Umbrella Activities


Umbrella Activities :

Software project tracking and control
Formal technical reviews 
Software quality assurance 
Software configuration management 
Work product preparation and production (activities to create models, documents, logs, forms, lists, etc.)
Reusability management (defines criteria for work product reuse and establish mechanisms to achieve component reuse) 
Measurement 
Risk management 



Identifying a Task Set:

A task set defines the actual work to be done to accomplish the objectives of a software engineering action.
--A list of the task to be accomplished
--A list of the work products to be produced
--A list of the quality assurance filters to be   applied

Attributes for Comparing Process Models :

Overall flow and level of task dependencies
Degree to which work products are identified and required within each framework activity 
Manner in which quality assurance activities are applied 
Manner in which project tracking and control activities are applied 
Overall degree of detail and rigor of process description 
Degree to which stakeholders are involved in the project 
Level of autonomy given to project team 
Degree to which team organization and roles are prescribed

Process Assessment :

SPICE (ISO/IE15504) standard defines a set of requirements for process assessment 

ISO 9001:2000 for Software defines requirements for a quality management system that will produce higher quality products and improve customer satisfaction 

Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) :

Level 0: Incomplete (process is not performed)
Level 1: Performed (tasks are being conducted) 
Level 2: Managed (tasks and products are monitored, reviewed, and evaluated for conformance to process description) 
Level 3: Defined (processes documented, standardized, and integrated into organization-wide software process) 
Level 4: Quantitatively Managed (software process and products are quantitatively understood and controlled using detailed measures) 
Level 5: Optimizing (continuous process improvement is enabled by quantitative feedback from the process and testing innovative ideas) 


Team Software Process :

Objectives 
Build self-directed teams that plan and track their work, establish goals, and own their processes and plans 
Show managers how to coach and motivate their teams and maintain peak performance 
Accelerate software process improvement by making CCM Level 5 behavior normal and expected 
Provide improvement guidance to high-maturity organizations 
Facilitate university teaching of industrial team skills
